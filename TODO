Bugs:
    P0:
        - Squashes explicit linebreaks and indentation (e.g. Matthew 5:3-10,
          Psalms) because LaTeX interprets as general whitespace
        - Normal choices of \text_wrapper (e.g. \texttt, \textit) can't wrap
          multiple paragraphs, gives error
    P2:
        - \end{document} isn't an elegant way to kill compilation, as it gives
          an error when used within an environment (other than document)
