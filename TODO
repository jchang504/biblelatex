Bugs:
    P0:
    P1:
        - Add standard style of indentation for poetry (e.g. Psalms, Proverbs)
        - Check if quotes within quotes work; fix if not. (E.g. "Then he said,
          'This is a quote within a quote.'")
    P2:
        - \end{document} isn't an elegant way to kill compilation, as it gives
          an error when used within an environment (other than document)
